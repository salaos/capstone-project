## CAPSTONE PROJECT

The social anxiety Web-Application is designed to help individuals overcome their social anxiety by offering a series of challenges that enable them to face their fears and develop new skills. Users can start with simple challenges and progress to more difficult tasks, all of which are intended to help them practice social skills and build confidence in a supportive, non-judgmental environment.

The Application includes creating own challenges and tracking tools that allow users to monitor their progress and earn rewards for completing challenges and reaching new levels. Additionally, the app provides a way for users to improve their social skills and conquer their fears in a fun and engaging manner.
